## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The user enters a natural language query describing their travel goals (e.g., location, budget, duration, interests).

2. **Preference Extraction**  
   The agent parses the input to extract structured data such as destination type, origin city, travel month, budget, and personal interests.

3. **Destination Recommendation**  
   Based on preferences, the agent suggests 2–3 destinations with contextual reasoning (e.g., climate, activities, budget fit).

4. **Transport Planning**  
   It recommends suitable transport options (e.g., train, flight, bus) with travel duration and cost comparison.

5. **Accommodation Suggestion**  
   The system suggests hotel options based on the user’s budget, number of days, and proximity to key attractions.

6. **Itinerary Generation**  
   A personalized, day-wise itinerary is generated, aligning with the traveler’s pace, preferences, and local highlights.

7. **Weather Simulation**  
   The assistant simulates destination weather for the given travel period, providing temperature, climate, and seasonal tips.

8. **Final Plan Summary**  
   A comprehensive travel plan is presented in a structured and readable format with a friendly summary message.
